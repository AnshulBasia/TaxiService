# TaxiService
An app based program to find shortest path between two locations and to provide a taxi service to customers similar to the real world.

This started as an assignment of Data structure course. I wish to improve it using implementation of Dijsktra with fibonacci heaps which will 
further reduce the coplexity of algorithm.
